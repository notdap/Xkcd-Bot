# Discord XKCD Bot
A copy of [Solarflame5's Xkcd Bot](https://github.com/Solarflame5/xkcd-bot/) built in C# instead of Python. It also likely is faster.

## Why?
C# Supremacy

## How to use it
Clone the repository, build it and run it. Upon its first run, it will create a file called `Token.txt`. Put your bot's token in that file and then start the bot again. Your bot should now be fully functional.
