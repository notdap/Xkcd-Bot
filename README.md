# Discord XKCD Bot
A copy of [Solarflame5's Xkcd Bot](https://github.com/Solarflame5/xkcd-bot/) built in C# instead of Python. It also likely is faster.

## Why?
C# Supremacy

## How to use it
Download the source, build it and add a file to the bin folder called token.txt containing your bot token. Then start it up and wait for it to create the slash command and then start using it.
